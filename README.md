# ReactCookBook
HomeCook is an online business that provides home cooked food to the customers. The application is built using React.Js, which has the following features:

 Home page that displays all the food items that can be ordered at that day. This means
that each day the menu changes.

 The food items will be shown along with the picture, price and the number of persons
that a single serving of the food serves.

 The meal has to be ordered 5 hours before the delivery time.

 While ordering the food, customer has to provide the number of persons for which the
food has to be ordered i.e. single serving, for two persons, three persons etc.

 On checking out, the system will calculate the total price of the ordered food by keeping
in view the number of persons added by the customer and the number of persons being
served by the single serving of the food.

 Finally, the system asks about the address where the food has to be delivered.
